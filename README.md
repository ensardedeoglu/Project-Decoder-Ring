Project description: Decoder ring

The app has 3 different decoders.
<br />
1.The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the
plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet.
<br /> 
2. The Polybius Square is a cipher that is achieved by arranging a typical alphabet
into a grid.
<br />
3.In cryptography, a substitution cipher is a method of encrypting in which units of
plaintext are replaced with ciphertext, according to a fixed system; the "units" may
be single letters (the most common), pairs of letters, triplets of letters, mixtures of the
above, and so forth.
